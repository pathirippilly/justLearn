1. if you are creating a table of columns with some precision , say varchar(20) or char(10). And if you try to insert a value which is greater than this precision,
	still the value will be getting inserted , but will be trimmed to the precision.
2.if in substr(<input string>,p,n) , even if you mention any p or n (integer only) which is not relevant in context of position or lentgh , it won't throw error but 
will return an empty string
3. index(split(<column>,<delimitter>),n), here if n>=length of the list, then it will return  NULL
4. To use position in order by or group by , you need to update hive.groupby.orderby.position.alias=True first in Hive
5. While running a Hive QL we need to be sure about following

In order to change the average load for a reducer (in bytes):
  set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=<number>
In order to limit the maximum number of reducers:
  set hive.exec.reducers.max=<number>
In order to set a constant number of reducers:
  set mapreduce.job.reduces=<number>

 7. set hive.enforce.bucketing=true : ensures buckets are populated according to the table definition
 
 8. Minimally, these configuration parameters must be set appropriately to turn on transaction support in Hive:

Client Side

hive.support.concurrency – true
hive.enforce.bucketing – true (Not required as of Hive 2.0)
hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode – nonstrict
hive.txn.manager – org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager
Server Side (Metastore)

hive.compactor.initiator.on – true (See table below for more details)
hive.compactor.worker.threads – a positive number on at least one instance of the Thrift metastore service

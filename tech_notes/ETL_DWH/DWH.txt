Data Warehouse architectures
******************************
1.EDW (Enterprise Data Warehousing):

>>Single Centralized Data Warehouse (A single RDBMS)which accepts ETL ouptputs from different sources
>>>This is the single point of source for all types of DSS/query tools/(OLAP/ROLAP)/Web Browsers/Data Mining

2.Single Departement Datamart (Federated Architecture):

>>Here Data is logically consolidated from different sources , but stored in different physical data warehouses
>> Here for different business area , different data mart (different RDBMS) will be there

3.Multi-tired architecture

>> This will have a combination of above two
>> ETL output is first collected into a single Data Warehouse and then seperated and stored in seperate datamarts

why staging area is reqiuired in an ETL proccess:
*************************************************
1. Source systems are only available for extraction during a specific time slot which is generally lesser than your overall 
data loading time. It’s a good idea to extract and keep things at your end before you lose the connection to the source systems.

2. You want to extract data based on some conditions which require you to join two or more different systems together. 
E.g. you want to only extract those customers who also exist in some other system. You will not be able to perform a SQL query
joining two tables from two physically different databases.

 
3. Various source systems have different allotted timing for data extraction.

4. Data warehouse’s data loading frequency does not match with the refresh frequencies of the source systems.

5. Extracted data from the same set of source systems are going to be used in multiple places (data warehouse loading, ODS loading, third-party applications etc.)

6. ETL process involves complex data transformations that require extra space to temporarily stage the data

7. There is specific data reconciliation / debugging requirement which warrants the use of staging area for pre, during or post load data validations


Staging area increases latency – that is the time required for a change in the source system to take effect in the data warehouse. In lot of real time / near real time applications, 
staging area is rather avoided.Data in the staging area occupies extra space.
To me, in all practical senses, the benefit of having a staging area outweighs its problems. 
Hence, in general I will suggest designating a specific staging area in data warehousing projects.

Why ODS is required and how it is different from staging:
*********************************************************
explnation Version1:

ODS can be considered as a staging area as the data can be stored here temporarily (about 45 to 60 days, this is not mandatory and is always debatable.). 
To understand this with a case, let’s assume that there is a startup and they have started their business in a geographic location where the sales would 
increase over 5 years and the in the beginning days or in the first 2 to 3 yrs they don’t anticipate any huge changes to the business and the sales.

Setting up an EDW (Enterprise Data Warehouse) can be costly and they don’t want to spend that much on that kind of setup yet. 
They can start with ODS. In ODS, they store that data for couple of months and back it up on to a hard drive regularly and will 
access the historic data as and when required.

After 5 yrs of successful business as the customer base and the sales have gone up they can plan for the EDW and when they do, 
they can migrate the data backed up in the hard drive for access to historic data for any BI reports.

Another case which can be taken here is ,of an eCommerce store. Now, getting the details of all the products from the EDW 
can be time consuming considering it’s a traditional relational DBMS, then the eCommerce company can have the ODS as the primary connect point to show case the basic details of
the product (for example the current discounts, delivery time and the related products etc.), which will make the product search easy as there will not be more data in ODS. 
Based on the user search then it can be moved onto EDW (for example user’s history of purchases).

When it comes to the staging area, the features of it are similar to what a ODS does like having the data temporarily and moving it to EDW at regular intervals.

But, usually the staging area’s functionalities are limited to an application or two.
ODS can be connected with multiple applications as it has the recent/current data. 

Well, if you ask me aren’t both relational, can’t we connect the staging to multiple applications? We can, technically it is possible.

And, the staging area is mostly the byproduct of an architecture which is specified for a single application but not for an enterprise. 
This point will be different for an MDM solution where staging can be used by multiple applications.

explanation version2:

Operation Data Store or ODS means the current data that is required to do quick analysis or near realtime reporting.

On the other side Staging is a dump of all data that you gather form multiple and heterogeneous Sources, you cleanse this data, apply multiple business rules, 
filter it and then push it to your Data Warehouse or ODS.

An ODS sits between your Staging/Factory and Data Warehouse. It gets a snapshot of most recent data, like if its a:
- Telecom provider it would store data of around 1 month to give you quick and detailed analysis on multiple calls/sms's done on a daily basis.
- Bank would store data for 3-6 months to 1 year for your day today transactions. That's why if you require 1-2 years of transaction details 
it takes bank 1-2 days to provide you that list separately.

If both will not manage an ODS it will become very difficult to provide quick details to their customers, and it will be a very slow process and also an 
overhead on their servers also.
